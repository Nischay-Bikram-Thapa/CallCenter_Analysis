## Recommendation

In overall, the advertising company is performing pretty well. It has attained global customer satisfaction of 8 on a scale of 1-9. The company seems to have more customers from United States due to increased number of issues with mostly inquiring for billing and payments. These issues were mostly reported via chat services to Support Center B and almost 89 percent of the problems were solved by the representatives. This is an impressive result with satisfying customers with great levels of efficiency, knowledge and professionalism. However, there were issues that remained unsolved and also an imbalance in the volume of problems received by different vendors. In order to obtain high level efficiency unresolved issues percentage must be reduced and the company must focus on frequently reported issues that could not be solved and distribution of works across all centers.
